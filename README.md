# Object-Oriented-Design
This repo contains Object-Oriented Design projects.

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) skills are a major plus for software engineers. They give interviewers an idea about the following:

- Whether the candidate can translate a complex problem into a concrete set of objects and identify interactions among those objects to solve the problem at hand.
- Whether the candidate can identify patterns while designing and, wherever applicable, effectively apply time-tested solutions instead of re-inventing the wheel.
